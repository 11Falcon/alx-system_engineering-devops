# Simple Web Infrastructure with Nginx, MySQL, and a Single Server

## Overview

This project outlines a basic web infrastructure consisting of a single server with components such as Nginx (web server), MySQL (database), and a simple application server. The goal is to host a website accessible via www.foobar.com.

## Requirements

- 1 Server
- 1 Web Server (Nginx)
- 1 Application Server
- 1 Application Files (Your Code Base)
- 1 Database (MySQL)
- 1 Domain Name (foobar.com) configured with a www record pointing to the server IP (8.8.8.8)

## Infrastructure Explanation

### Server

A physical or virtual machine with the IP address 8.8.8.8.

### Domain Name

www.foobar.com is a human-readable alias for the server's IP. The domain is configured with a DNS record pointing to the server's IP (8.8.8.8).

### DNS Record

The www in www.foobar.com typically corresponds to a CNAME (Canonical Name) DNS record pointing to the domain (foobar.com).

### Web Server (Nginx)

Nginx serves as the web server, handling incoming HTTP requests, managing static content, and acting as a reverse proxy to forward dynamic requests to the application server.

### Application Server

An application server interprets and executes the application code, generating dynamic content. It communicates with the web server to serve responses to client requests.

### Application Files (Code Base)

The source code of the web application resides on the server and is executed by the application server to generate dynamic content.

### Database (MySQL)

MySQL is used as the relational database management system (RDBMS), storing and managing the data required by the web application.

## Communication Flow

1. User enters www.foobar.com in their browser.
2. DNS resolves www.foobar.com to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).
3. Nginx handles static content and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
4. Application server executes the relevant code and communicates with MySQL if necessary.
5. Web server sends the generated response back to the user's computer.
